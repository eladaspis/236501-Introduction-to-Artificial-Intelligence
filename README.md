## Wet 1 - Ambulances collect corona tests
A system that includes ambulances that collects corona tests.
The system takes into account the stock of test equipment while moving through various laboratories to collect equipment and transfer the tests from the ambulance to the laboratories.

The system uses different algorithms such as A*, A* epsilon , BFS and AnyTime*.

In addition, I used different heuristics throught the project.

## Wet 2 - Play against the computer

A snake game against the computer that uses different Heuristics (described in the documentation document).

During the project, I used various algorithms like MinMax, AlphaBeta etc.
